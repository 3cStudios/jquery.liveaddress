Quick Start
-----------------------

1. Be sure jQuery is brought into your page early on. If you don't already have it, something like this should do the trick:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>```

2. Bring the LiveAddress API jQuery Plugin onto your page:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="//d79i1fxsrar4t.cloudfront.net/jquery.liveaddress/2.0/jquery.liveaddress.min.js"></script>```

3. Initialize the plugin with an HTML key from your account:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">$.LiveAddress("YOUR-HTML-KEY");</script>```

That's it! Ensure it works before using it on a live site. SmartyStreets
assumes no responsibility if something goes wrong on your web page. Enable debug mode
to help you find problems, and if necessary, map the fields manually. See the
[full documentation](http://smartystreets.com/kb/liveaddress-api/website-forms) for details.



Test Runner File
-----------------------

The [index.html](https://github.com/smartystreets/jquery.liveaddress/blob/master/index.html) file provided can be used
as a convenient, mostly-isolated environment in which to test different scenarios. Knock yourself out! Better
in testing than in production, right?
