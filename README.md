Quick Start
-----------------------

1. Be sure jQuery is brought into your page early on. If you don't already have it, something like this should do the trick:

```<script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>```

2. Bring the LiveAddress API jQuery Plugin onto your page:

```<script type="text/javascript" src="//d79i1fxsrar4t.cloudfront.net/jquery.liveaddress/2.0/jquery.liveaddress.min.js"></script>```

3. Initialize the plugin with an HTML key from your account:

```<script type="text/javascript">$.LiveAddress("YOUR-HTML-KEY");</script>```

That's it! Give it a try to make sure it works, before deploying it live. SmartyStreets
assumes no responsibility if something goes wrong on your site. Turn on debug mode
to help you find problems, and if necessary, map the fields manually. See the
full documentation (link above) for more info.
